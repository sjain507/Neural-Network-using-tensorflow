Implementing Neural Network by classifying handwritten digits from MNIST data in python using tensorflow

Preparing for the recently launched [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018), I realized it was imperative to know inner workings of a Neural Network. I decided to start with a simple program to get a gist of neural nets. This type of problem (Image Recognition) is a great use case for Deep Learning Methods!

This is my encounter with tensorflow and I have referred steps from experienced kagglers to simplify understanding. I will be using the famous MNIST data set of [handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
